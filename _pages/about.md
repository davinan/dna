I am a 4th year undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology working at [Prof. Mitchell's lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/) on artificial intelligence for biomedicine applications and collaborating with [Dr. Mu Gao](https://sites.gatech.edu/cssb/mu-gao/) on the problem of protein folding using deep learning.
